# Algorythms
Implementations of chosen algorythms in C language
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hobby project containing simple and educational implementations of popular algorithms written in C.
The goal of this repository is to practice algorithm design, improve C programming skills, and gain a deeper understanding of fundamental data structures and sorting techniques.

All implementations are written from scratch and kept as simple and readable as possible.
This project is not intended for production use, but for learning and experimentation.

Algorithms coming up soon:
bucketSort.c, coctailSort.c, countingSort.c, gnomeSort.c, heapSort.c, insertionSort.c, mergeSort.c, quickSort.c, radixSort.c, shellSort.c
